					Former primary teacher with a background in Mathematics who thoroughly

					Naturally curious and highly self-motivated, I am comfortable working
					independently to explore solutions but equally enjoy collaborating in
					pairs or teams to share ideas and refine outcomes. I am always keen to
					learn and continuously seek out more effective ways of approaching
					problems.
