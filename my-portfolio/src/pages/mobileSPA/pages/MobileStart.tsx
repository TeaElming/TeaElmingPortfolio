    <h1>Tea Elming</h1>
    <h2>Software Developer</h2>

    <p>
			Former primary teacher with a background in Mathematics who thoroughly
			enjoys problem-solving and being technically challenged, thus deciding to
			return to university to study Computer Science.
    </p>
    <p>
			Naturally curious and highly self-motivated, I am comfortable working
			independently to explore solutions but equally enjoy collaborating in
			pairs or teams to share ideas and refine outcomes. I am always keen to
			learn and continuously seek out more effective ways of approaching
			problems.
