      <h3>One of my favourite past times.</h3>
      <p>
        I have been training different martial arts for over 20 years. I have been lucky enough to get to spend a lot of time in Thailand the past few years, training Muay Thai daily. Great for fitness â€” and a surprisingly accurate metaphor for debugging: take hits, stay calm, and remember it's all part of the process.
